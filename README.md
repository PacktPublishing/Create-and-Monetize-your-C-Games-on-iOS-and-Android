## About the Video Course
	In this course, we are going to learn the fun part - creating a game! We will start by designing the game and how you want it to work, before learning about the basic game loop and an introduction to the physics system Farseer.

You will then move on to building our game by starting with the platforms that the player will jump on, and then actually create our main character, Zippy. You then need to create some enemies to make the game more interesting and add some collectibles to get as you progress.

The final part will then put all this together into a level class, as well as creating the UI and the main menu so that players can navigate to different sections of the game. When the course is complete you will have a cross platform C# engine that you can then use to create their own games, as well as a simple game that they can expand and improve upon. 

Now that we have finished our game we will be adding the last finishing touches before releasing it into the wild! First, we will start by monetizing the game with in-app purchases as well as discussing the theory of rewarded video ads.

The next section will then implement achievements and leaderboards as well as implementing Google Analytics so that we can see how players will use our game.

We will then move on to releasing our game on both iOS and Android, discussing the release procedures for both as well as how to release the game.

Finally, we will discuss the future of our game and our engine, discussing how to release updates on both platforms, how we can update our game and further optimisations we can make to improve performance.
